about="🍅 The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. \n📚 Basic principles:\n1️⃣ Divide your work into short 25-minute intervals (called “tomatoes”), followed by short 5-minute breaks. \n2️⃣ After four such “tomatoes,” take a longer break ranging from 5 to 25 minutes.\n\n🎯 The goal of the method is to help you concentrate, avoid burnout, and increase productivity."
